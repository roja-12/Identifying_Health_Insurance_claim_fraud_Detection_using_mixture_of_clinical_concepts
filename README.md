This system tackles fraudulent insurance claim detection using only procedure and diagnosis codes due to legal and system constraints on richer datasets. It introduces Mixtures of Clinical Concepts (MCC), representing claims as combinations of diagnosis and procedure codes. The approach is enhanced with LSTM (MCC + LSTM) and RPCA (MCC + RPCA) for better feature extraction and classification. MCC + LSTM achieves 59% accuracy on inpatient and 78% on outpatient datasets, with improved precision and recall. MCC and MCC + RPCA show similar results, both using SVM classifiers. The method proves effective and consistent, offering a promising solution using minimal data.
